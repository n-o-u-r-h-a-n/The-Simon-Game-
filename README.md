# The Simon Game 
Implementing the well-known Simon Game as a website using JavaScript and Jquery where players should repeat a specific pattern of buttons. The Game Pattern sequence increases in length each round thus enhancing player's memory.

The HTML and CSS code sections were previously written and I was just focusing on the functionality of the game and wrote the code from scratch using JavaScript and jQuery. I have learned how to listen to click and keypress events and reply accordingly to ensure correct order of smooth gameflow.
